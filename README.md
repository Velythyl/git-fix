# git-fix
Fixes your .git by murdering it ðŸª¦ and replacing it with a clean one. Use at your own risk!

All local .git changes will be lost. This is not recommended for serious use, but I find myself using it a lot for personnal projects. I am not responsible for any loss of data/code/etc. resulting from using this script.

# What it does

This clones your repo from source, rips out the .git file, and replaces your local .git with it. Any .git changes will be lost, even if they were committed (but your local files will stay the same!). For example, this is useful when you mess up and commit a file which requires git LFS, and then want to uncommit it, which is very annoying to fix.

Instead of messing with your .git, you can `git fix` and replace your .git with a clean one from your repo's source ðŸ§¹

This takes branches into account ðŸŒ´

# Usage

Simply type `git fix` as though this script was an actual git command. 

# Install

Run `install.sh`. This will add the `git-fix` script to your `/home/$USER/.local/bin`.

# Oops! I actually needed my old .git!

We actually didn't completely murder it. You can find it in `old.git` local to the new `.git`. Do note, though, that `git fix` does not check for the existence of a `old.git` and will overwrite it ðŸ“‹ should you run `git fix` again.
